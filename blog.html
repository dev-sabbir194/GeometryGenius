        <h1 class="text-4xl">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>
    <p class="mt-5">DOM stands for Document Object Model. It is an interface that allows programs and scripts to interact with webpages. It defines the logical structure of a webpage, thus allowing the content of the page to be modified and manipulated. DOM is important because it allows web developers to create dynamic websites that can interact with the user.</p>

    <h1 class="text-4xl">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods.</h1>
    <p class="mt-5">To select HTML elements using the Document Object Model (DOM), there are three main methods: <br>



        1. querySelector(): This method is used to select a single element from the DOM. It takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns the first element that matches the selector. <br>
        
        
        2. querySelectorAll(): This method is used to select multiple elements from the DOM. It takes a CSS selector as an argument and returns all elements that match the selector. <br>
        
        
        3. getElementById(): This method is used to select an element from the DOM by its unique HTML id attribute. It takes the id of the element as an argument and returns the element.</p>

    <h1 class="text-4xl">3. What is event bubble?</h1>
    <p class="mt-5">An event bubble is an area of influence caused by an event or identified phenomenon. It is a spherical area that encompasses the event's impact, stretching outwards and affecting the people and places around it. Event bubbles can be small and localized, or large and global, depending on the nature and scope of the event.</p>

    <h1 class="text-4xl">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>
    <p class="mt-5">A callback function is a type of function in programming which is passed into another function as an argument. It is then used to execute code at a later point in the program. Callback functions are most often used to handle events and asynchronous calls and are particularly useful when an action needs to be performed only after another action has been completed. This helps to keep the program code organized and easier to read and debug.</p>
